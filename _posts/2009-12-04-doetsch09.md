title: Logistic Model Trees with AUC Split Criterion for the KDD Cup 2009 Small Challenge
abstract: In this work, we describe our approach to the ``Small Challenge'' of the
  KDD cup 2009, a classification task with incomplete data. Preprocessing, feature
  extraction and model selection are documented in detail. We suggest a criterion
  based on the number of missing values to select a suitable imputation method for
  each feature. Logistic Model Trees (LMT) are extended with a split criterion optimizing
  the Area under the ROC Curve (AUC), which was the requested evaluation criterion.
  By stacking boosted decision stumps and LMT we achieved the best result for the
  ``Small Challenge'' without making use of additional data from other feature sets,
  resulting in an AUC score of 0.8081. We also present results of an AUC optimizing
  model combination that scored only slightly worse with an AUC score of 0.8074.
